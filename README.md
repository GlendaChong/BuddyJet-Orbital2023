# Motivation 
Are you tired of manually tracking your monthly expenses using a Google Sheet or notes? Or do you ever feel like your bank account is depleting much faster than you anticipated but do not know where to start with budgeting? Tracking our own expenses is often too time-consuming and we might forget to input certain expenses due to the sheer number of details. This causes individuals to lose the motivation to continue tracking their spending. Tracking our expenses can reveal our spending habits, which is essential to guide our budgeting process, such as to determine which category requires adjustments in expenditure, or whether we are spending beyond our means. 

Furthermore, many people struggle with financial budgeting due to a lack of knowledge, self-discipline, and simply not tracking their expenses. This often leads to overspending without a clear understanding of where their money is going. Over time, this can accumulate and diminish their savings, or even worse, eventually lead to debt accumulation when their income cannot sustain their lifestyle. Budgeting and tracking of one’s expenses comes hand in hand, which is why we hope to make expenses tracking and budgeting easier for everyone. 

We believe that personal finance is crucial in holding ourselves accountable for our money, and the habit of managing personal finances should start young. This is why we decided to target young adults, as they start earning their own income and financing their own expenditure.

# Aim 

We aim to ease the process of personal financing (i.e. expenses tracking and budgeting) of young adults through the implementation of a user-friendly and educational mobile application. 

# User Stories

1. As a new user, I am required to create a new account with my personal particulars, which includes name, phone number, date of birth, email address and password. 
2. As a registered user, I am required to log in with my email and password to access the app. 
3. As a forgetful user, I can request to reset my password via email to access my account again. 
4. As a young adult who is spending on various budget categories (i.e. transport and food), I want to be able to categorise my expenses easily according to the different categories.  
5. As a young adult who often dines out with friends and families, and is required to split the bill among the group, I want to be able to record who made the payment expenses for the group first, and record my individual expenses already without calculating it myself (i.e. the app divides the bill among number of people). 
6. As a young adult who wants to manage my finances through budgeting, I want to be able to set monthly budgets and track my progress towards them. I want to be able to receive alerts when I exceed my budget or am approaching my limit that I set for myself. 
7. As a young adult who might need to pay certain bills, I want to be able to set reminders for upcoming bills or payments. 
8. As a young adult who wishes to understand my spending clearer, I want to be able to generate either a simplified or detailed report (users are given a choice) and comprehensive visualisation of my spending habits in each category. I want to also be able to compare my spending across months. 
9. As a young adult who is unsure about financial planning, I want to be guided along to do my budgeting. This can be in the form of personalised financial advice or tips based on my spending habits and financial goals and priorities. I want to learn how to manage my money better using frameworks (e.g. 5 pillars of financial literacy) as a start. 
10. As an administrator who wishes to keep track of my app usage, I want to be provided with detailed analytics on the app usage and user behaviours, such as most commonly used features, user demographics, and trends in spending habits. 
11. As an administrator who wishes to constantly update budgeting tips for users, I want to be able to identify which kind of tips or planning tools users prefer the most.

10. Providing support for multiple currencies (aside from just SGD): 
* Users spending with overseas currencies, such as purchasing online goods, spending overseas, or investing, may want to record down their spending using the overseas currencies instead of SGD. The app should be able to convert the expenses into SGD based on the exchange rate at that point in time (i.e. based on the date the expenses are made, indicated by user). 
* Inclusion of location with maps to be added together with each expenses included, for users who wish to record where they spend their money on (e.g. eating at Restaurant A, watching a movie at Shopping Mall B)
* Create customised recommendations to address users specific financial needs/goals, by suggesting ways on how they can reduce their expenditure on categories which exceed their budget. 
For example, if the user is spending a lot on transport, the app will suggest some tips/reminders like take the public transport instead. 

**Note:**
* Other features/pages of our main app will be fully and beautifully designed by Milestone 2. They are currently a work in progress. 
* Deployment of our app for user testing and user guides will also be done by Milestone 2 too.
