# Motivation 
Are you tired of manually tracking your monthly expenses using a Google Sheet or notes? Or do you ever feel like your bank account is depleting much faster than you anticipated but do not know where to start with budgeting? Tracking our own expenses is often too time-consuming and we might forget to input certain expenses due to the sheer number of details. This causes individuals to lose the motivation to continue tracking their spending. Tracking our expenses can reveal our spending habits, which is essential to guide our budgeting process, such as to determine which category requires adjustments in expenditure, or whether we are spending beyond our means. 

Furthermore, many people struggle with financial budgeting due to a lack of knowledge, self-discipline, and simply not tracking their expenses. This often leads to overspending without a clear understanding of where their money is going. Over time, this can accumulate and diminish their savings, or even worse, eventually lead to debt accumulation when their income cannot sustain their lifestyle. Budgeting and tracking of one’s expenses comes hand in hand, which is why we hope to make expenses tracking and budgeting easier for everyone. 

We believe that personal finance is crucial in holding ourselves accountable for our money, and the habit of managing personal finances should start young. This is why we decided to target young adults, as they start earning their own income and financing their own expenditure.

# Aim 
We aim to ease the process of personal financing (i.e. expenses tracking and budgeting) of young adults through the implementation of a user-friendly and educational mobile application.
